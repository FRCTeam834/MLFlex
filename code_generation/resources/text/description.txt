Hello fellow FRC (or FTC, if it works for that!) user. In our personal quest for vision, we looked at many options. Neural networks seemed to be king, however, they were out of reach of teams without a coding professor. Through some off-season research, we found a solution to create a complete vision ecosystem. Most of the code files were long, repetitive, and hard to shorten. Therefore, we created this tool for all teams to use. Help can be found under the help tab - FRC Team 834.
